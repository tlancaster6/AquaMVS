<objective>
Execute notebooks on real hardware and commit with pre-executed outputs for RTD rendering.

Purpose: RTD is configured with nb_execution_mode = "off", which means it renders stored cell outputs as-is. Without pre-executed outputs, notebook pages on RTD will show blank output areas. This checkpoint requires the user to execute both notebooks on real hardware (with GPU and example dataset) and commit the results.
Output: Both notebooks committed with visible cell outputs (text, plots, tables)

  <action>
  This is a CHECKPOINT task requiring human execution. Claude cannot execute notebooks that require GPU and real dataset.

  Plans 02 and 03 created two Jupyter notebooks with correct code but empty cell outputs. RTD is configured with nb_execution_mode = "off", which renders stored outputs without re-execution. Without pre-executed outputs, notebook pages on RTD will show blank output areas.

  **User must:**
  1. Ensure the example dataset is available (download from GitHub Releases if needed)
  2. Execute the API tutorial notebook:
     ```bash
     cd docs/tutorial
     jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebook.ipynb --inplace --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600
     ```
  3. Execute the benchmarking notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute benchmark.ipynb --inplace --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600
     ```
  4. Commit the notebooks with outputs:
     ```bash
     git add docs/tutorial/notebook.ipynb docs/tutorial/benchmark.ipynb
     git commit -m "docs(08): add pre-executed notebook outputs for RTD rendering"
     ```
  </action>

  - `python -c "import json; nb=json.load(open('docs/tutorial/notebook.ipynb')); print(sum(1 for c in nb['cells'] if c['cell_type']=='code' and c.get('outputs')),'cells with outputs')"` shows multiple cells with outputs
  - `python -c "import json; nb=json.load(open('docs/tutorial/benchmark.ipynb')); print(sum(1 for c in nb['cells'] if c['cell_type']=='code' and c.get('outputs')),'cells with outputs')"` shows multiple cells with outputs
  - `pytest tests/test_notebook_smoke.py -v` still passes after outputs are added
  </verify>
  <done>Both notebooks committed with pre-executed cell outputs. RTD renders visible results (text, plots, tables) without re-execution. Smoke tests still pass.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Both notebooks have non-empty `outputs` arrays in their code cells
- `pytest tests/test_notebook_smoke.py -v` still passes
- `git diff --stat HEAD~1` shows both notebook files modified with increased size (outputs add data)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Both notebooks are committed with pre-executed cell outputs. RTD will render these outputs inline without re-execution. Smoke tests continue to pass.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/08-user-guide-and-tutorials-overhaul/08-04-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
