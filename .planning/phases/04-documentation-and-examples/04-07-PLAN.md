<objective>
Close Gap 2 from verification: Connect GitHub repository to ReadTheDocs and verify deployment.

Purpose: `.readthedocs.yaml` config exists and Sphinx builds locally, but ReadTheDocs has not been connected. Documentation is not publicly accessible.
Output: Live documentation at https://aquamvs.readthedocs.io/

  <name>Task 1: Connect GitHub to ReadTheDocs and trigger build</name>
  <action>
The user needs to:

1. **Go to ReadTheDocs**: https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/
   - Sign in (or create account) using GitHub OAuth

2. **Import the project**:
   - Click "Import a Project"
   - Select `tlancaster6/AquaMVS` from the repository list
   - Project name: `aquamvs`
   - Default branch: `main`
   - Click "Next" / "Build"

3. **Wait for initial build** to complete (typically 2-5 minutes)
   - The `.readthedocs.yaml` in the repo will be picked up automatically
   - It installs PyTorch CPU + git prerequisites before building Sphinx docs

4. **Verify** the documentation is live at: https://aquamvs.readthedocs.io/

5. **Report back**: "deployed" if docs are live, or describe any build errors
  </action>
  <resume-signal>Type "deployed" if docs are live at aquamvs.readthedocs.io, or paste build error output</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify ReadTheDocs deployment and fix build issues</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
After user confirms deployment:

If user said "deployed":
- Fetch https://aquamvs.readthedocs.io/ and verify it returns 200 with HTML content
- Verify key pages exist: /en/latest/installation.html, /en/latest/api/index.html
- Note success in summary

If user reported build errors:
- Analyze the error output
- Fix `.readthedocs.yaml`, `docs/conf.py`, or other files as needed
- Commit fixes and ask user to trigger a rebuild on ReadTheDocs

If user said "skip":
- Note in summary that ReadTheDocs deployment is still pending
- This is acceptable as a non-blocking gap
  </action>
  <verify>
If deployed: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://aquamvs.readthedocs.io/` returns 200
If skipped: Note in summary
  </verify>
  <done>ReadTheDocs deployment verified as live, or build errors fixed and rebuild triggered, or gap documented as deferred.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- ReadTheDocs project exists and is connected to GitHub repo
- Documentation builds succeed on ReadTheDocs
- https://aquamvs.readthedocs.io/ is publicly accessible

<success_criteria>
- Documentation is publicly hosted and accessible at aquamvs.readthedocs.io
