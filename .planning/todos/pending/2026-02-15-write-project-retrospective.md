## Problem

With AquaMVS nearing completion (4 of 5 phases done), there's valuable experience to capture before context fades. A structured retrospective will preserve insights for future projects and personal growth.

## Solution

Write a retrospective document covering:

1. **Lessons learned about agentic coding** — What worked well with Claude Code / GSD workflow, what didn't, how the human-AI collaboration evolved over the project, effective prompting patterns, when to intervene vs. let the agent run

2. **New libraries and tech stacks explored** — PyTorch for geometric computation, kornia, LightGlue/SuperPoint, RoMa v2, Open3D, Sphinx/Furo documentation, Pydantic config validation, pre-commit/Ruff toolchain

3. **Workflow pain points** — Friction points in the development process, CI/CD challenges (Open3D headless, git dependencies on PyPI), dependency management issues (LightGlue not on PyPI, RoMa dataclasses bug), testing challenges

4. **Future directions** — Where AquaMVS goes from here, potential research applications, integration with AquaPose, performance optimization opportunities, community building
