# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Accurate refractive multi-view stereo reconstruction — cameras in air, geometry underwater, Snell's law bridging the two.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2 planning

## Current Position

Phase: 01.1 (Last-Minute Feature Additions)
Plan: 2 of 2 plans complete
Status: Complete — phase 01.1 finished
Last activity: 2026-02-14 - Completed 01.1-02-PLAN.md: Pipeline enhancements (outlier removal, consistency maps, image input)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 40% (1 of 5 phases complete, 2 of 2 plans in phase 01.1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 9.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.63 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01    | 2     | 20min | 10min    |
| 01.1  | 2     | 17min | 8.5min   |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (15min), 01-02 (5min), 01.1-01 (5min), 01.1-02 (12min)
- Trend: Stabilizing around 8-10min per plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- PyTorch over NumPy for internal math (GPU support, differentiability)
- Dual pathway (LightGlue sparse + RoMa dense) for different accuracy/speed tradeoffs
- Package as both CLI + library to serve pipeline users and custom workflow developers

**Phase 01 Plan 01 (2026-02-14):**
- PyTorch as user-managed prerequisite with import-time check (not in pyproject.toml)
- LightGlue pinned to commit edb2b83 (v0.2 release) via git URL
- RoMa v2 pinned to user fork at tlancaster6/RoMaV2 (dataclasses metadata fix)
- AquaCal as standard PyPI dependency (aquacal>=0.1.0)
- prereq-docs strategy: Document LightGlue and RoMa as manual install prerequisites for PyPI compatibility

**Phase 01 Plan 02 (2026-02-14):**
- Matrix testing across Ubuntu and Windows with Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 (6 combinations)
- Trusted Publishing (OIDC) eliminates API token management for PyPI uploads
- Three-stage publish pipeline: build -> TestPyPI -> PyPI with manual approval gate

**Phase 01.1 Plan 01 (2026-02-14):**
- Lazy imports in CLI handlers to avoid loading cv2/Open3D at parse time
- Circular buffer for memory-efficient temporal median filtering
- Auto-compute normals for STL export (Open3D requirement)
- Format detection from output_path suffix for mesh export

**Phase 01.1 Plan 02 (2026-02-14):**
- Outlier removal enabled by default (nb_neighbors=20, std_ratio=2.0)
- Consistency map colormap normalized by number of source cameras, not per-frame max
- Viridis colormap for perceptual uniformity and colorblind accessibility
- Auto-detection of input type (image directory vs video file) based on path.is_dir()
- ImageDirectorySet validates matching filenames and frame counts across cameras

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 1.1 inserted after Phase 1: Last-Minute Feature Additions (URGENT)

### Pending Todos

1. **Mint a Zenodo DOI** (general) — Link repo to Zenodo, add `.zenodo.json`, get citable DOI

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 Dependencies (RESOLVED in 01-01):**
- ✓ LightGlue: git dependency pin to edb2b83, documented as prerequisite
- ✓ RoMa v2: git dependency pin to user fork, documented as prerequisite
- ✓ AquaCal: standard PyPI dependency (aquacal>=0.1.0)
- ✓ PyPI compatibility: prereq-docs strategy allows PyPI upload
approved
**Phase 3 Refactoring:**
- Backward compatibility scope needs definition — audit which APIs are public vs internal to minimize breakage

### Quick Tasks Completed

| # | Description | Date | Commit | Directory |
